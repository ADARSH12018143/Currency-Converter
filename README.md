# Currency-Converter
**Currency converters aim to maintain real-time information on current market or bank exchange rates, so that the calculated result changes whenever the value of either of the component currencies does. They do so by connecting to a database of current currency exchange rates.**

An easily accessible online currency converter is very useful to show travelers how their own currencies will fare when exchanged with other foreign currency. 
Moreover, currency converters help international import and export businesses by helping them determine the selling and buying profits of different products.
